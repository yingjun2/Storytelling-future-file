### Summary of the story
LUO Ji is an astronomer and sociologist, together with Frederick Tyler, former US Secretary  of Defense, Rey Diaz, former President of Venezuela, and Bill Hines, English neuroscientist, acts as the wallfacers for the Earth. The aliens from three body star are attacking us and their science technology are more advanced than us. The only key lies in strategy and mental thinking. LUO Ji at first is unwilling to take the position, but accepts it in the end and finally proposes a most brilliant idea to save the earth. He made it.



### cultural origins
LUO Ji is the protagonist of the science fiction novel - Three body problem. He is not a stereotype hero, that is smart, brilliant and better than anyone else. Instead, he is less ambitious than others, and human is under advanced than three body aliens, and Luo Ji doesn't even wants to be the wallfacer. 

This figure establishment combines the culture of Chinese character - smart but mild, sometimes, not willing to take the responsibility.

The novel receives lots of awards [check below for more information], and has been translated into different languages.

### adaptation ideas
The story is awesome because it is both hard-cored (strong in technology) and soft-cored (strong in social science, easy to spread). Telling this story can also be in these two directions: hard and soft. 

1. Hard: Use technology and visualization methods, like Star War, to demonstrate the political atmosphere of the star war in the story. Give specific description to LUO Ji's solution.
2. Soft: Use only mouth and music, to describe LUO Ji's changing the attitude. The depression on earth before and the happiness on earth after are a great contrast to catch and describe.



### other comments
