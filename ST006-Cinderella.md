### adaptation ideas

1. If the audience is young, let's say, younger than 8, describe more on the fairy part - how the magic draws the carriage, the dress and the shoes. 
2. If the audience is old, let's say, older than 12, describe more on the ugly faces when the step mother and sisters try to fit the crystal shoe and how they ill-treat Cinderella.
3. Use a soft and descriptive tone.

This story challenges the storyteller's ability to describe setting and surroundings.
