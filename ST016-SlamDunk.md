### cultural origins
About Slam Dunk Manga, it is the most famous sports-themed manga series written on Weekly Shonen Jump from 1990 to 1996. The manga received special commendations from Japan Basketball Association for helping popularize basketball in Japan.

Sakuragi is the main protagonist of Slam Dunk, serving as Power Forward. What impresses the audience is not the game played by them, but the spirit that never give up.



### audience and setting
* The suggested age range is 6+, and better 14-22. 

* As a sports-theme story, no background is needed.

* The setting of the story is better quiet and easy to share pictures or videos.

### adaptation ideas
1. I have an idea to demonstrate the story with a series pictures (mile stone or big events in Sakuragi's lifetime). Instead of using movie or manga, people will focus more on the story itself. 
2. Of course, we can import the movies or manga, but that will weaken the story.

b)     Introduce the background to the audience (from the US) whose culture might be different from the story.

c)     Add the moral / influence section after the end of the story.



### other comments

We are all fighters against life. So we do need to challenge ourselves, just like Sakuragi does. 

To pass the passion for life is the reason I choose this story.
