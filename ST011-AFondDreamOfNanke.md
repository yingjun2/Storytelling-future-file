### summary of the story
In Tang Dynasty, Chun Yufen, on his birthday, got drunk under a tree, near an ant nest. But he dreams about a fantastic experience for the following 20 years including becoming the emperor, marrying the princess, and leading the troops. When he woke up, he finds out it is just a dream.

 

### cultural origins
There is a long-lasting discussion in Chinese culture that whether we are true, the difference between dream and reality, and the connection between dream and reality. Yufen's dream reveals his sub consciousness. However, it is just a dream, or a real whole life. Who knows.

### adaptation ideas

1. The key to adapt and tell the story is to emphasize the comparison between dream and reality. There should be a clear contrast between, and it helps a lot to exaggerate the scenes in dreams.
2. Add more details in the dream sections to convince the audience that it is true. If so, make the structure  of the story to be hero journey which contains a climax and the turnabout at the end.
