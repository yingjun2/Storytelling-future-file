### Audience and setting
* The audience can be of any age. 
* Not any background is needed, since the story itself is the background.

### Adaptation ideas

1. There are lots of *useless* details in the story, which is useful in describing the society but not for pushing forward the story. For younger audience, focus more on the plot, but for the older, focus more on the history and the bigger picture of society.
2. It's not a bad idea to watch the movies.
3. Better do some further research if the audience is of high education background.
