This corpus serves as Yingjun's future storytelling bank, and also Yingjun's course assignment for LIS409 Storytelling.



This corpus contains more than 20 stories from diverse cultural background, languages, age ranges, and race topics. However, there's one common characteristic from all - they are all about people, human being, and specifically, interesting life stories from people.  Most of the stories are real, or at least revised based on real stories from real people. 



As a doctoral student from the graduate school of library and information sciences, I feel proud to be concerned with people. And This is always the case in my current research and future career path. Human's emotions are complicated and sometimes hard to express, which is also the charm of storytelling.



Also as an international student, I do cherish the diversity of the corpus. We can observe that in the corpus, the origins of the stories include China, Japan, United States, India, France, England, Germany, etc. The occupation of the protagonists include Emperor, general, scholar, monk, god, poor girl, prince, rich person, super hero, teacher, mayor, and even president!

For each story, you can find the sources, brief summary, and the cultural origins in the documentation. More importantly, you can find useful suggestions on the target audience, the settings and the adaption advice. I also provides my other comments on why I like the story. Hope all these help and benefit your reading.



Last but not least, I want to show special thanks to Dr. Kate McDowell and kindest TA Melissa Hahn. Thank you for leading me into the amazing world of storytelling. And I do enjoy storytelling! I do wish in my future career, I will continue equipping storytelling as one of my weapons!
