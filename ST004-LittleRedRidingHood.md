As one of the most world-famous tales, there are different versionsof the story. It is said that the earliest version is from French peasants in the 10th century. However, the most famous two versions are by Charles Perrault and Grimm Brothers. The most outstanding difference in two versions are the name and the ending part: Charles' story named "Little Red Riding Hood" has a bad ending, while Grimm Brothers' story named Red Cap has a happy ending.

### audience and setting
* If the audience is younger than 14, tell the Grimm Brothers' version; if the audience is older than 14, tell the Charles' version.
* Noticing there's potential sexual meaning lying behind the story, *Only if* the audience is  older than 18, tell them research on the symbolism of sex, pregnancy, and genders.
* The setting of the storytelling needs to be somewhere quiet and listenable, for example, hospital, museum, and library.



### adaptation ideas

1. Pay special attention that the morals behind different versions of the story are different.
2. Those symbolisms are not appropriate for all-age audience.
