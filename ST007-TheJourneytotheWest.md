### adaptation ideas

1. If the audience are young, focus on the fairy part of the story. For example, how Monkey king transforms and how he fights. If the audience are middle aged, tell more about life stories, like corruption, sex, and trivial life stories happened in the journey. And if the audience are of high educational background, tell more on the belief background, for example, why they pursue for Buddhism and conflicts with Taoism. 
2. The tone can be exaggerated. 
3. Add some performance or lyrics will be good.
