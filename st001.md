### adaptation ideas
a)     Insert the music element into my telling the story to strength the atmosphere, which also helps to control the time.

b)     Introduce the background to the audience (from the US) whose culture might be different from the story.

c)     Add the moral / influence section after the end of the story.

### other comments
I personally love this story so much. Since my first time I’ve heard of it, it keeps haunted in my mind, and this may be the most popular and moving folktale in China
