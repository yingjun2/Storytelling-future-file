### summary of the story

Prometheus, son of Titans, who fought against the god, Zeus, notices that human who live on the lands don't have fire to keep warm and keep away from the darkness. However, Zeus regards fire as one of the sacred thing and not willing to give to men. Kind and merciful as Prometheus was, he disobeyed Zeus and gave fire to men. However, he was chained to the side of a montain to suffer there for all eternity.



### cultural origins

The story is adapted from Greek mythology, which also entitles How Prometheus gave fire to men. The story can also be related why the Olympic games set fire at the opening ceremony. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_flame#Torches)

Prometheus also becomes the symbol of bravery, kindness and civilization. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft_of_fire)

There's also a short movie discussing on this story: "How people got fire"

### audience and setting

* The suggested age range 6+, without educational background. 

* It's better to have setting at libraries or museums, where we can play the video and music. The movie "How people got fire" will be a hit on the story.

  ​

### adaptation ideas
1.  If the audience is between 6-12, focusing on the description of how people live without fire and how Prometheus lives chained on the mountain.

2. If the audience is older than 12, focusing on the symbolism of Prometheus, and the relationship of Prometheus (Titan) and Zeus.

3. Introducing the movie "How people got fire" to the audience.

### other comments
* It would be a good idea (?) to let audience discuss or imagine the environment when people are living without fire.
