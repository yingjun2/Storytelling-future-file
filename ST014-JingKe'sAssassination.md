### audience and setting

* The audience needs to have some history background.
* No fixed settings, but libraries are preferred if the movie and novel (mentioned above) are to be shared.



### adaptation ideas

1.  If not, provide them some the info on the relationship between Yan and Qin. And clarify why assassination is the only solution for Yan.
2. The tone to express should be calm and steady. 
3. 3rd person narration and 1st person narration both work, but perform differently.



### other comments

If allowed, do show them the novel and the movie. totally worth it.
