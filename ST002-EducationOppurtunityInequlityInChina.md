### Summary of the story
In China, students in the rural area and urban area are enjoying different education opportunities, eg: selecting schools, chance to finish middle school, opportunities to go to college, etc.

### Audience and setting
* Teens and above who can correctly understand common social problems.
* Relevant department who can help deal with the problem.

### Reasons I choose this topic
This is super important since education to me is the definition of future. And it is pretty urgent to have this solved or at least put it on the table since the inequality is unignorable.

### Adaptation ideas

a) Tell with passion, seriousness and love.

b) For a social justice story like this, it is important to be convincing and persuasive. But most important, make the statement vividly and clearly.
